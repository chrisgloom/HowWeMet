    <h1>So How did Yall Meet?</h1>
    <p>Is a common question you expect to get when meeting new friends as a couple. But it's a bit of a shame that even
      though Kristen and I have a really wonderful love story, there aren't often very many questions after our initial
      answer:</p>
    <h2 class="scary-tinder">We Met On <div class="vibrate-1">tinder</div>
    </h2>
    <p>People usually respond quite politely with an, "oh wow!" or maybe: "that's neat" while I assume inwardly
      questioning how they had managed to find themselves mired in the social company of two flaming hedonists.</p>

        <source src="natureCouple.mov">
      </video>
    </center>
    <p>Now as the most sociologically likely target of such slander I would like to say first: how dare you. And second:
      there were essentially two ways to meet Kristen Laurent in the early Summer of 2019:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be tucked away behind a redwood somewhere in the San Lucia mountains, looking casually woodsy and hoping to
        make a good first impression</li>
      <li>Be on Tinder</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I was on Tinder.</p>
    <center>
      <video width="200" height="200" playsinline autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="kSoftSmile.mov">
      </video>
    </center>
    <p>But what I think is unfortunate about having to lead with that is that our <em>real</em> romance was epistolary.
      And it can be hard to depict an epistolary romance without saying, "Well if you want, I can scroll all the way
      back and show you the receipts."</p>
    <p>Now I'm well aware that that's essentially the social equivalent of patting the sofa, pulling out a scrapbook,
      and just really putting the ol' axe to a good half hour of some poor soul's limited time on this blessed earth.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15vh;">But for a wedding? Well. You're practically obligated aren't you. I'll put the
      kettle
      on.</p>

    <h1>A Poetics of Two Spaces</h1>
    <center>
      <img src="kInTheFoliage.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>Dear reader, I've never been much of a fan of the cellular phone application we call tinder. But dopamine is a
      helluva neurochemical. It was a late night in June and there was ol' swipey dangling possible matrimony on a
      string in front of my weary eyes.</p>
    <p>Normally, historically, this experience began with steadily lowering standards and ended with a splash of
      app-fatigue that made me swear the whole process off altogether but tonight was destined to be different.</p>
    <p>But soft what profile through yonder cellphone breaks.</p>
    <p>Reader, there are many attractive people in this world but there is only one Kristen and my immediate (and
      accurate) reaction as I read her profile was "This person is out of my league."</p>
    <center>
      <img src="kCave.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>I could already sense my emotions gathering themselves into what I can only describe as a Very Romantic Feeling.
      If you haven't spent much time internet dating, this is known as "getting your hopes up" and it is
      Dangerous. But as I swiped through her pictures, I came across a layout of some books. My eye landed on <em>The
        Poetics of Space</em> by Gaston Bachelard and my heart exploded into pieces.</p>
    <center>
      <img class="pulsate-bck" src="poeticsOfSpace.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>In more erudite parts of the world such as Nueva York, I've since learned, it's entirely <em>de rigueur</em> to
      regularly
      encounter people around your same age who share some fairly-niche, artsy interest of yours and still have them be
      just another person in a sea of persons.</p>
    <p>In Houston, Texas, we freak out, we fall in love immediately, and we super like them.</p>
    <p>We pick up the message thread just a few messages in as we've just moved to texting. All that was on Tinder was
      lost
      when we both deleted tinder, oops. But you can see how quickly our correspondence has lengthened.</p>
    <p>There are
      paragraph breaks. There are "This message is too long to send" warnings. We are having a conversation about
      multiple topics at once and respond to each of them in kind. It's the kind of text that, were a friend to see you
      reading it over your shoulder, would elicit an "Oh god."</p>
    <p>The kind of texting that's clearly either the birth or the death of something, in other words.</p>
    <p>In our case it was the big bang.</p>
    <p>I've included the section from when we moved off tinder to our first in person meeting. Use the next and previous
      buttons when you've got the gist I don't expect anyone to read it thoroughly but hopefully you get a sense of the
      words and language and creativity that brought us together and was the foundation for the way an initial
      attraction grew into the nourishing, loving, and whole life we've built together that we're here to celebrate.</p>

        <div class="speech-bubble-christopher">I didn't intend to write a tiny novel and now looking back on
          this I'm worried we're in some sort of message length arms-race without knowing it haha.<br>Thank
          you for the tadpole well wishes and being very sensitive to my loss. It's taken me some time but I
          have eventually moved past active grief into an acceptance that life is cruel and directionless and
          that the center cannot hold. Sometimes tadpoles succumb to the exact same existential dread that
          pangs us all and, feeling the call of the void, jump into whatever new plane of existence their
          personal belief system has convinced them lies in those hinterlands just off the mortal coil. It's a
          sad state of affairs and I'm convinced that it has something to do with violent video
          games.<br><br>Dogs are often silly but I think just as often they have moments of quiet and infinite
          wisdomâ€”I imagine Waffles' unfortunate appellation left a bit to be desired whenever they felt the
          need to express their more pensive side, which is a shame. Louis Amadeus clearly would suffer no
          such fate. That's the kind of name that could lead men to their deaths for a cause. Probably in
          France. Probably in the 18th century. Plus it's extra charming when a dog with such a regal name
          does something silly. That's just silly twice over at that point. It's win-win.<br><br>Time and
          Structure are both really good Concepts with which to anchor a familiar. Provided he doesn't eat his
          children. Though maybe then he'd have to be named Cronus. Or maybe there's a doppledog out there
          somewhere named Cronus who is seemingly Saturn in shape and form but just wasn't adopted into your
          pantheon in quite the same way and lives a kind of echo life just out of your line of
          sight.<br><br>I hadn't thought about it but yes I have been having interesting dreams lately. There
          has been quite a lot of music being written in them. I'll wake up and turn on my computer to record
          a little video of me humming the songs that were in my dreams that morning. I think this morning it
          was bach or something very bach-tangent and baroque. Harpsichord was involved for sure.
          <br><br>Actually now it's 9am(saturday morn') and I just woke up to a recording of one that I
          apparently had last night at 3am but I have absolutely no memory of what I groggily mumbled into the
          computer haha. Let's see what we've got here. <br><br>"I'm in some sort of department store that
          sells hiking gear and I'm being mischievous and putting label maker labels on places that I find
          amusing and eventually I go to leave and they're like hey we gotta make sure you didn't steal
          anything and that's fine because I didn't steal anything but the only person they have to spare
          right now is this guy with long dreadlocks working over in the corner and he's seems pretty busy.
          <br><br>I'm standing on this mound of what looks like pieces of cardboard. Basically cardboard
          concave shells with sections in them like a takeout container or something covered in some oily
          substance. He comes over and dashes some powder all over them. As he does this, the pieces of
          cardboard burst into fungus. Gorgeous intricate colorful fungus wherever the substance touches that
          also grows into big spikes almost like it's a yucca flower and I'm like 'Wow that's cool.' And then
          the fungus grows really tall on those spikes and starts smelling really strongly of vinegar and so I
          leave the big towering mound and go down to where I see him working on this root kind of thing next
          to a wrought-iron gate.<br><br>It's like an olive branch, really knurled and tough and his job is to
          cut it off the gate. There's a section already hanging open and just inside the hardened outer bark
          is a too-bright red solid, looking like room temperature sherbert or something. And I say hey sorry
          to bother you again but I need you to check my pockets and stuff to make sure I didn't take
          anything. And he's like 'Sorry I'm busy you know I've gotta chop this thing down." and so I try to
          pull off a little bit of it and he's like 'No you're not going to make any headway like that," and
          it's true I barely chip it at all. And he's like 'Actually, if you want to do somethingâ€¦' and I'm
          like 'Yeah yeah of course."<br><br>'There's a place 50 miles by foot from here where they have what
          I need to chop this down. And it's going to take a lot of work but you can do it if you want.' and
          I'm like 'Yeah of course,' me being willingly to do just about anything to leave this dream health
          food and camping gear store. And then I just woke up. And it's three in the morning."<br><br>Not
          entirely sure what Jung would say about that. I'm sure Carl would have some thoughts. Maybe the
          yucca fungus is my anima.<br><br>I haven't seen it yet!
          I've looked at their website a few times and saw nothing so I'll probably just wait until someone
          says something to me about it haha. Better than looking at local tv news this often haha. I feel
          like I lose a tiny shard of my soul every time I pull it up.<br><br>Thank you for validating my
          right to peaceably protest any and all moves to texting. And to protest in general. Both vital and
          valued. I wish you many personal revelations and reflections in your wilderness. May you be
          receptive to your lack of reception.<br><br>The Whitman reading was judged on four categories haha.
          Volume, Clarity, Speed, and Whitmanism and we each graded each other's performance on a sliding
          scale of 1 to 5. It was super super fun. Afterwards one of the contestants, Jonathan, read some real
          estate blurbs aloud at the mic which was wonderful to hear dramatically read.<br>

        <div class="speech-bubble-kristen">My apologies for the slow response, finally passed through a
          receptive area today and got a chance to see your entertaining and impressive updates. First off,
          congratulations on your big Whitmanian win! Will your victory object serve as shelf decor, a tiny
          cauldron, a receptacle for dreams &/or tears, or a chalice of sorts? I can't say I've ever
          experienced a dramatic performance of real estate ads before, but that sounds like a great way to
          end such an already successful night. <br>I'm happy to hear your healing process has been
          progressing since your loss. The violent video games are certainly a potential source, or perhaps
          maybe even the lack of amphibian representation in public media leading their young and susceptible
          identities to a false sense of invisibility and low self esteem? <br><br>I absolutely concur with
          your statement regarding canine wisdom. I learn something from Saturn everyday, and I feel like it
          has something to do with some sort of cosmic power that's resting beneath his crystal blue eye.
          Louie Amadeus could barely lead himself to the back yard, although it's a lovely vision to imagine
          him leading an entire revolution. <br><br>Haha, thankfully there is a veterinary surgery available
          nowadays that will mean we won't ever have to worry about Saturn eating his children. Just my
          carpet, as it seems. I hadn't considered the possibility of a doppledog before, and now I find
          myself feeling thrown into the lookout for this Cronus because even if he does eat his children, he
          still sounds adorable in appearance at least and I would love to pet him. <br><br>Your dream
          certainly sounds like it's worth keeping the lead around if it means you are able to engage with
          your subconscious in such a vibrant way as that. Has this dream returned to you yet so you could
          find out what was awaiting you 50 dream miles away? I'm also curious to know what kind of tool would
          successfully cut down this sherbet filled branch, you know, in case I ever encounter a similar dream
          conundrum.<br><br>I have been very receptive to
          the lack of reception and have had many lovely reflections as a result. Finally headed out of the
          desert landscape portion of this trip and heading into the lush foliage of the Yosemite backwoods in
          the morning. Most has been peaceful on the journey, with the exception of my stay in this shed
          (picture below) one night, which was apparently built in the middle of a wildlife commune involving
          bats, coyotes, and many bugs I'd never seen before. At least there were also holes in the sides of
          it (which at first was not such a positive) so I could at least peek out during the several
          sleepless hours of that very long night to make sure all were minding their own animal business and
          not actually plotting a break in to carry me away to an undesired fate. Couldn't do much about the
          bugs, given the holes, but it seems I have survived the trials of the desert. As far as I know, I'm
          still alive.<br></div>

          management application haha. Ultimately I also would trust either side of the makeover to offer some
          very intriguing conversation and dreamscape imagery, which can never amount to a lost cause!</div>

        <div class="speech-bubble-christopher">This isn't a slow response at all! I was fully prepared for a
          radio silence lasting at least a week if not more and that makes you about two days ahead of
          schedule by my count. I have no idea how you're managing to hike, eat, and also keep up lengthy,
          quality, and dare I say engaging correspondence with those of us back in the concrete jungle; it
          seems bordering on superhuman from my perspective.<br>It's definitely a chalice whether I choose to
          think of it as a chalice or not. I feel like it has inalienable chalice qualitiesâ€”despite its
          creator clearly going for more of a trophy vibe. I do feel like ever since I started acquiring
          multiple and distinct sizes of recorder there's been a misbalance of phallic to yonic symbology in
          my personal effects so I welcome all chalices won, earned, or gifted as a general rule until things
          balance back out. It's been on a couple different windowsills and they all look better for it and
          I'm really conflicted about which one it eventually should live on.<br><br>At the moment I'm using
          it to hold these little cardboard circles I cut out, painted, covered with glitter mod podge, and
          stuck my phone number on in case I make friends while out and about and there's been at least two
          occasions where it would have been useful to have my little friend-pogs on me but have of course
          forgotten to take them out of the dream chalice before leaving the house. woops. Entirely possible
          that the dream chalice has made the decision that I should make no new acquaintances and instead it
          will leech away my lifeforce as I spend more and more time in my room sleeping close enough for it
          to do, uhhh, whatever weird leech-y thing it does. I can't pretend to know everything about how it
          works exactly. But I'm sure it's malicious.<br><br>Kermit, one of the rare frog voices in mass
          media, said it first and best, it really isn't easy being green. It would take a few years for the
          viewing public to find out the harsh reality of that statement and the impact it's had continues to
          reverberate through our current culture, leaving its mark on everything from shrek to teenage mutant
          ninja turtles. Everyone keeps saying, "go green" and "green new deal" when they don't understand
          what it means to BE green, y'know. It's just not easy.<br><br>Your bravery and curiosity in pursuing
          and meeting possibly filicidal ghost dogs is extremely admirable and I will 100% dedicate any
          resources I can bring to bear towards making contact with Cronus. Maybe we can set up some sort of
          summoning circle. Possibly with kibble. Wait what's the arcane, otherworldly, and unknowable
          opposite of kibble because that sounds more like what he'd be into. Like, flan? or something? I
          might be showing my inexperience here haha.<br><br>I haven't had the dream again but my dream logic
          self does remember that the tool was clearly some sort of pruning sheers? Despite never being able
          to actually see or retrieve it. I am curious as to what the inside of the branch tastes like though
          so if you end up encountering it in the dreamscape maybe give it a try and let me know. I feel like
          we're only a few qualia away from being able to compile a tiny pamphlet on dream botany and tbh
          that's the kind of life I need to be living in 2019 haha.<br><br>Desert trials at night
          surrounded by coyotes sounds harrowing and it's entirely possible that you crossed over into the
          spirit realm at some point leaving your physical existence to prune in the desert sun but if so you
          remain eloquent as ever even in this diaphanous form and it's quite a pleasure to continue to hear
          from youâ€”corporeal or not. <br><br>Also that looks like a lovely little desert hideout. I am the
          kind of person who, if given the chance to be above things, vertically speaking, will always be
          above things so you definitely would have found me on that top platform if it's big enough to allow
          sleeping. And yes probably also only ever half asleep thinking about coyotes slowly encircling on me
          howling and calling in a mournful, vaguely hungry, devouring-y sense. That's mildly to severely
          terrifying. I am thankful there were holes from which to peep the current state of the coyote
          encroachment.<br><br>Also re: diaphanous forms I'm not sure they let the dead on airplane rides back
          home. Something tells me not, with how weird they already are about shoes. Ghosts, spirits, and/or
          haunts would seem to be even farther on the scale towards contraband. They at least count as an
          extra bag and you probably have to check them and wait for about 20 minutes as they come 'round the
          carousel after landing. Tedious to be sure.<br><br>Which is all to say that I hope you're alive. And
          remain alive for the foreseeable future.<br></div>

          with it's much more likely I'll be returning as a superbug than as a superhuman, but I'm happy to
          hear that I've managed to stay ahead of communications! If my correspondence starts including weird
          or cryptic symbols it's likely that I've begun my entomological evolution into whatever mystery bug
          it is that bit me last, but here's hoping it won't come to that. <br>With the lamentable amount of

          with your assessment fully. Definite chalice. In the name of yonic representation I hope you find an
          appropriate amount of chalices continuing to come your way, although maybe a variety of related
          symbols could do the trick as well. Like a horseshoe or two perhaps, which would not only help add
          to that balance but also could maybe bring some good luck to counteract the possible leeching
          behavior of your new chalice. <br><br>I feel like a chalice that's been obtained through sweet
          victory makes for an excellent windowsill ornament, and would probably be best on whichever one gets
          the most direct sunlight. That way it can continue to bask in the glow of some sort of spot light,
          and also hopefully improve its mood by soaking up enough cheery vitamin D energy to avoid any
          further ill intent. I've found no scientific evidence to support such an effect of vitamin d on the
          mood of possibly sentient objects but it could be worth a try. Friend-pogs, especially those made
          with glitter mod podge, deserve to be shared when the moment calls for one and not be withheld by
          malicious chalices. <br><br>A truism if I ever heard one. People still just don't take the time to
          truly understand the lived experience of green beings. They'll sport the slogan tshirts and bumper
          stickers to appear "on green trend", but what has this empty kind of performative activism really
          accomplished? The memory of all the green youth gone to soon deserves much more. <br><br>Considering
          the still very real possibility I've become a ghost after the many near-miss trials of nature I've
          encountered this past week, it might be slightly easier now for me to navigate the planes on which
          ghost dogs exist. In the case that I'm still a very opaque human, I also have plenty of great
          conjuring materials including some fresh desert sage and yerba santa. If you bring the flan
          (definitely an anti-kibble material), then I think we're all set for some serious summoning action.
          I deeply appreciate your investment in helping me accomplish this doppledog union! <br><br>Ah yes,
          pruning sheers do seem like the ideal tool for that job. I'll keep that in mind should my dream
          world allow me the chance to encounter such a situation, and I surely hope it does. Honestly even
          the just the phrase "dream botany" alone brings me so much joy and intrigue that should such a
          pamphlet ever come to exist, I may not ever be able to involve myself in anything else again haha.
          Dreaming and planting are two of my favorite pastimes so to merge them would be really
          something.<br><br>If my
          corporeal form is in fact pruning in the desert or forest somewhere and it turns out I'll be
          returning in spirit alone, I do hope my travels back to Texas tomorrow go smoothly regardless - off
          grid nature time was wonderful but I am ready to reunite with a real bed haha. Depending on what
          ghost stereotypes turn out to be true or not, maybe being nothing more than translucent energy will
          actually serve in my favor as far as air travel goes. If they can't see me, then I could probably
          just skip the security line all together and take whichever flight I please. I've had several
          very-much-alive-looking people interact with me today though which tells me I'm probably coming back
          on the same plane of consciousness I started this trip on.<br><br>The desert box had a very lovely
          platform on top, and I can definitely appreciate that same urge to want to be above a thing if
          possible. In fact I sought this structure out specifically so I could be high up, safe to stretch
          out and stargaze without the likely threat of snakes, scorpions, coyotes, etc invading my space. Had
          not considered the possibility of bats, which are the only reason I did not actually wind up
          sleeping up there, though was very tempted. <br><br>I managed to get a video of the first of many to
          make their presence known, admittedly less threatening in appearance with the cotton candy sky in
          the background. But after that one turned into a full on colony, all flitting around a bit too close
          for comfort, I decided the possible threat of rabies was not worth taking the risk.<br></div>

        <div class="speech-bubble-christopher">It wouldn't bug me in the slightest if you turned out to be a
          giant talking locust or some sort of migrating beetle. I have a number of big tree roaches that seem
          to think that my apartment seems a nice place to crawl into at night and if I had an interpreter I
          could probably get away with not constantly engaging in a war of attrition with small and nearly
          indestructible insects. Maybe the roaches and I could work out some sort of parley. Or I could sell
          them a timeshare with a few choice stipulationsâ€”feel free to hang out while I'm at work during the
          day but you have to leave when I get back. Or if you're going to be around while I am then you'll
          have to learn how to wear little suits and walk on two legs and be proper. This is now a
          professional household and I'm afraid appearances must be kept up. If there are to be roaches they
          should appear seemly and cordial at all times.<br><br>While you're dealing with bug bites, I apparently
          rode my bike too much this past week and my knees have decided to begin sending me strong messages
          to please never do that again. So now I'm harboring a knee brace on my right knee and I'm going to
          the doctor next week at which point I will absolutely demand to please be allowed to ride bikes
          again without it shortly thereafter severely disrupting my ability to walk.<br><br>I had a similar
          experience but in Greek Orthodox churches. It was lovely. My family wasn't religious so I never
          really had to rebel against them. Instead I just got to appreciate the chanting and swinging of
          large pendulous ceremonial incense burners. Both things I remain highly in favor of.<br><br>The
          horseshoe is an amazing symbol. It's like a lazy ouroboros; almost there lil' guy keep going you'll
          eat your tail one day. Wait or maybe that would make him a really industrious and indefatigable
          ouroboros. Regardless I've been really into archetypes and Things That Are Just Themselves lately
          and that's a really really good one.<br><br>The chalice is currently resting on a windowsill that
          gets absolutely blasted with daylight constantly so the vitamin D is surely flowing through its clay
          veins. I look forward to its mood improving. At very least maybe a second or third firing will do it
          goodâ€”like the sun might remake it every day in a new and interesting image.<br><br>Green youth
          oriented slacktivism is an absolute epidemic and something must be done about it. Social media has
          created an entire generation that will mindlessly change their profile frame without ever turning to
          the streets, or sewers when it comes to teenage turtles "mutant" or not(highly ableist term that no
          one should ever apply to turtles. I hesitate even to reproduce it here but know that I do so purely
          for clarity), when it really matters. Rise up green youth, like grass, like garden snakes, like 532
          nanometer lasers aimed skyward. But do watch out for planes that's vaguely illegal and rather
          distracting to the pilot. Other than that keep rising up though.<br><br>Usually I'd only use Yerba
          Santa around Christmas but I'd be willing to make an exception for this particularly dire situation
          in which we find ourselves. Sage, advice or plant, is always handy. You never know when you might
          need to purify something. So many diseased spirits around that might come crawling when word gets
          out that we're calling on a ghost dog. I'm sure there's many a spook that would love to leap into a
          deceiving form and gobble up some fresh flan what's not theirs. Despicable and uncouth behavior but
          it's been known to happen.<br><br>I'm quite experienced at dreaming and hope to get better at
          planting! At the moment my two successes have been with a dragon tree and an aloe, both of which I
          believe are known to be rather hard to kill and they've thankfully lived up to that mantle. Both
          have been extremely forgiving as I learn their wants and rhythms. There does also exist a paper lily
          I received for christmas that shot up like a weed and promptly began to encounter trouble and now it
          lingers in a horrible half-state between life and death. I tried my best but clearly my best mostly
          killed it. I am really enjoying the plant life though. They make my apartment feel so much more
          friendly and alive and meaningful.<br><br>Hmm a good test for ghostliness (which is next to
          godliness) might be to attempt to inhabit a few electrical or mechanical devices. I believe I've
          heard that being devoid of any kind of sylphs of their own they might be ripe for a wandering
          consciousness to slip in and out of. Maybe you could rig up a talking light post or two. Or one that
          shines especially bright on any good deeds that happen in its vicinity. I'm always on the razor's
          edge between whimsy and altruism so sneaking in both is my only hope haha. If left to my own devices
          as a pestering poltergeist I'm ashamed to say I might resort to something cruel like tying shoelaces
          together which is moderate on whimsy and extremely poor on altruism. I strive to do
          better.<br><br>If you could take any flight that you please as a spirit (possibly a spirit flying on
          Spirit) which ticket counter would you be surreptitiously slipping behind? I've been feeling a lack
          of sleepy mediterranean backstreets in my life recently so I might be tempted to find a tiny greek
          village somewhere to wander.<br></div>

        <div class="speech-bubble-christopher">Wowww what a lovely scene. I adore bats. I go down to Waugh
          bridge basically any chance I can get to watch the frenzy. If I get rabies as a result it will have
          been well worth it. Also I'm usually quite spritely so they'd have to do an expert swoop and bite
          combo to really get me and at that point they've earned their rabies convert. I will froth safe in
          the assurance that I was bit by the best and bravest bat babe or bat boy or bat bounding beyond the
          binary.<br><br>Those views are absolutely gorgeous and I want to paint it. I mean I'd do a horrible job
          with my mediocre painting skills but it's so good. Also the fire is relaxing and equally
          well-framed. Hank Williams is doing a brilliant job of injecting a touch of timelessness into the
          scene like a rough-hewn twang-ridden hypodermic needle. Such a good eye took these charming and
          well-contained moments of human life. Thank you for sharing them.<br><br>Here's hoping the air
          underneath the wings of your airplane is moving much slower than the air above them. And also that
          the view out the window is nice; but if you can't have both hopefully at least the first.<br></div>

        <div class="speech-bubble-kristen">As exciting as a new life in the form of a ghost, locust, or
          migrating beetle would have been, I can officially announce that I have withheld my human form after
          all (a rather dull conclusion to the adventures of the past couple weeks). Although after several
          flight delays that left me stranded in the Las Vegas airport all night and then finally returning
          early yesterday morning, I embraced a lengthy slumber so deeply that I may have astrally projected
          at some point, but it's all just so hazy so I couldn't say for sure. <br><br>While remaining human I
          suppose has countless benefits, on the downside it does mean I unfortunately won't be able to help
          you out with the tree roach translating. I could however offer my hand stitching skills to fashion
          them some appropriate wardrobe options if for some reason due to socioeconomic barriers they are
          unable to afford suits of their own. Your stipulations for coexisting are really not asking much of
          them at all, and I hope all parties involved can arrive at a positive resolution despite not sharing
          a common language. <br><br>I'm sorry to hear about your knee misfortune, it's never a good time when
          the things we love bring us pain. I hope the doctor clears you and and your knees to get back to the
          bliss of bike riding life as quickly as possible!<br><br>The ouroboros is indeed a really really good one! And
          a symbol that has been showing up in
          my presence curiously often lately. Synchronicity abound it seems. I would love to hear more about
          your interest in things that are just themselves! Some of my favorite things are those that are, in
          fact, just themselves - probably why I have such a propensity for spending extended amounts of time
          in nature. Maybe we could finally arrange that coffee shop hang out soon and add this to the agenda
          of inventing words and identifying indigo children. <br><br>I very much appreciate you clarifying
          and recognizing the ableist vocabulary so thoughtlessly charged upon the teenage ninja turtle
          community. Language matters and more people could stand to be as cognizant of the way their "labels"
          oppress others. May the green youth rise indeed, and yes, hopefully while avoiding any vaguely
          illegal and dangerous aeronautical mishaps. <br><br>Haha happy to hear you're flexible with your use
          of festively named herbs! While indeed most powerful during the Christmas holiday, especially when
          paired with a milk-and-cookies sacrifice (how else would cheer in the form of material goods arrive
          in the dwellings of children all around the world in just one night), Yerba Santa has also been
          known to respond to flan offerings at any time of year as well. <br><br>Dragon trees and aloe plants
          are both lovely choices! I also like to concern myself with plants that are hard to kill, given my
          inclination to take spur of the moment trips and not always being able to find a last-minute plant
          sitter for those occasions. Sorry to hear about your paper lily, sometimes they just don't thrive
          they way we'd hope, but not for lack of trying. My last-ditch effort for plant resuscitation is
          usually to repot it, but if that doesn't do the trick then all one can do (as far as I know so far)
          is offer it words of encouragement and affirmation so its spirit doesn't burn out completely.
          <br><br>Consider me a huge fan of your ghostliness gauges - I think a balance of whimsy and altruism
          would be an excellent basis for a spectral spectrum to apply to haunts, apparitions, manifestations,
          etc. Honestly speaking, my ideal ghost self would love the idea of being a light that shines on all
          good deeds, but my realistic ghost self would likely be inclined to give a good spook once in a
          while just for laughs. Maybe the whimsy-heavy gags such as the classic shoelace entanglement could
          be reserved for bully-adjacent characters who may need a dose of humility thrown into their
          existence? Clearly I also need to strive to do better haha. <br><br>I actually did fly Spirit on my
          way back, although sadly not as a spirit. That would have been too good to be true, for purely
          logophilic reasons only (that airline has been the source of many a headache when traveling the
          skies recently). Your Grecian wanderings sound like an excellent choice, a part of the world I'm sad
          to say I haven't encountered yet. I would probably find my way onto a flight to Iceland, mostly so I
          can finally confirm my theory that if you hike far enough out into the wilderness there, Bjrk
          emerges from the terrain to bless you with a sprinkle of volcanic ash and a welcome song. <br><br>I
          hope that one day I shed enough of my own inhibitions to no longer fear rabies and fully be able to
          appreciate an intimate proximity with bats. They are fascinating creatures, nonetheless. I've never
          been to that bridge, but I've visited the one in Austin a few times enough to enjoy the mystical
          black river that forms in the sky when it's time for them to fly off into the night. <br><br>I
          always like to take a Bob Ross/laissez-faire approach to painting, so I'm sure if you tried to
          replicate those Big Sur skies it would be full of only "happy accidents" haha. Hank Williams does
          have a way of creating both a timeless and hypodermic mood, definitely what I was going for so I'm
          glad that resonated haha.<br>
